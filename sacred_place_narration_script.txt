> Cave Art 4 - How The Beaver Got His Tail <
- There was a muskrat whose house got flooded. It was nearly winter and the muskrat had no place to stay.
- At the time, this muskrat had a tail like the beaver we see toady, except it wasn't flat on the ground but it was sticking up.
- While the beaver had a small, skinny tail.
- The muskrat went to seek the beaver for help. When the muskrat met the beaver, the beaver looked at the muskrat's tail.
- "Why are you here? Why do you have such a nice big tail for an animal like you?", the beaver asked.
- "There was a big flood and my house got flooded with water. Now I have no place to stay", the muskrat responded
- "I will let you stay with me if you are willing to trade tails," the beaver offered.
- The muskrat agreed, knowing he had no other choice if he didn't want to freeze in the winter.
- The two rodents traded tails, now the beaver has the bigger tail.
- This is the story of how the beaver got its tail.
